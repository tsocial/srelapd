## Config Generator

- The generation script expects two arguments, one is input data file and other is perimission config.
- Permission config has groups for which configuration needs to be generated.
- 'sre' is expecting default group and it's group_id.
- Pass the user_id and group_id for a  corresponding group.
- A user 'searcher' record has to be added, as it is expected by LDAP server.
